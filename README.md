# lolcarp

[Lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)-like terminal colors in Carp.

## Usage

The API only consists of one function, `write`, which takes in a string and prints it
to the standard output with random Lolcat-like colors applied.

Other Lolcat features, such as inversion and animation, are planned as well.
